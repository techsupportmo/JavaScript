 In some circles, Apple’s iOS operating system has long been considered the more secure of the two operating systems. Why? Apple’s operating system is a closed system. Apple doesn’t release its source code to app developers, and the owners of iPhones and iPads can't modify the code on their phones themselves. This makes it more difficult for hackers to find vulnerabilities on iOS-powered devices.

Android devices are the opposite, relying on an open-source code, meaning that the owners of these devices can tinker with their phone’s and tablet’s operating systems. Too much tinkering, and owners might create a weakness in their devices’ security. Then there are manufacturers themselves. If a phone maker puts out a new device with a modification to the Android operating system and there’s a vulnerability in that code, hackers will find it.

Android is more often targeted by hackers, too, because the operating system powers so many mobile devices today. The global popularity of the Android operating system makes it a more attractive target for cybercriminals. Android devices, then, are more at risk of the malware and viruses that these criminals unleash.

But this doesn’t tell the entire story. While iOS may be considered more secure, it’s not impossible for cybercriminals to hit iPhones or iPads. The owners of both Android and iOS devices need to be aware of possible malware and viruses, and be careful when downloading apps from third-party app stores. It’s safest to download apps from trusted sources, such as Google Play and the Apple App Store, which vet the apps they sell.

Then there are the social engineering attacks in which cybercriminals attempt to trick users into giving up log-in information, access to bank accounts, and other personal data. It doesn't matter what mobile operating system you are using: both iOS and Android can be equally vulnerable to these types of phishing attacks.
